The sole difference is that the factors must multiply together to make a negative number as their product, so an odd number of the factors must be negative. 1  For example, let's factor -60.- 2 60 = -10 × 6. - 3 60 = (-5 × 2) × 6. - 4 60 = (-5 × 2) × (3 × 2). - 5 60 = -5 × 2 × 3 × 2.he sole difference is that the factors must multiply together to make a negative number as their product, so an odd number of the factors must be negative. 1  For example, let's factor -60. - 2 60 = -10 × 6. - 3 60 = (-5 × 2) × 6. - 4 60 = (-5 × 2) × (3 × 2). - 5 60 = -5 × 2 × 3 × 2.

1576	6446453	60x40 slab cost	For example, the aforementioned survey found that the installation cost for slab granite that costs $10 per foot is $35 per foot, meaning the slab-total ratio is around 3.5. On the other hand, the installation cost for a high-end granite slab that goes for $40 per square foot is $66, translating to a 1.65 slab-total ratio. Put another way, this ratio drops drastically as the price of granite slab increases. Still, installation costs account for about 50% of the cost of a slab granite countertop.
