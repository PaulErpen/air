In this exercise we were tasked with solving three different information retrieval related tasks.
We decided that each team-member should be responsible for their own task.
Our rational behind that was that for each task there would be one person that is the expert on the topic that is treated by that task.
We updated each other on the progress and lessons learned in multiple group meetings over the duration of the exercise.

We divided the work in the following way:
    * Part 1: Julia Putz
    * Part 2: Paul Erpenstein
    * Part 3: Dario Giovanni

## Part 1: Data aggregation process

## Part 2: Neural Re-Ranking

In the second part of the exercise we had to implement, 
two different type of neural reranking models, train them
and finally test them on different data sets.

## Part 3: Extractive QA
